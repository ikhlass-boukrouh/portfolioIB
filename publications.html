                                    <p class="pub-abstract"  style="text-align: justify";>
                                        Sales forecasting is an essential task for businesses as it enables suppliers to analyze customer preferences,
                                         thereby optimizing profits, reducing costs, and minimizing product returns.  
                                         Confronting the complexities of sales forecasting, this research introduces a new hybrid model for sales forecasting that combines classic time series analysis with advanced deep learning techniques to address the limitations present in existing forecasting models. This model combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) to capture complex patterns, handle linear trends and seasonal patterns, and emphasize recent sales trends. A comparative analysis using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric demonstrates the enhanced performance of the hybrid model over the individual components. The findings indicate that the hybrid model surpasses LSTM, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters models by 9%, 39%, and 43%, respectively. This improvement in forecasting accuracy significantly benefits marketplace management by offering more reliable sales predictions. Applying this model facilitates the prediction of sales for the next â€˜nâ€™ days, informing inventory management, pricing strategies, and promotional planning to optimize sales performance.</p>

                                    <p class="pub-abstract"  style="text-align: justify";>
                                        Improving operational processes significantly relies on choosing the right suppliers, which emphasizes the importance of using effective evaluation methods. This study explores supplier evaluation through a detailed framework involving five Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approaches. These methods consider seven main criteria and twenty-one sub-criteria. In this research, the determination of weights for each criterion and sub-criterion is carried out through a multifaceted approach. Subjective methods, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy AHP, which rely on expert judgments, are employed alongside objective techniques including Entropy, which is based on empirical data. Hybrid methodologies like AHP-Entropy and Fuzzy AHP-Entropy, which combine elements of both subjective and objective methods, are also utilized. The integration of these diverse methodologies ensures a thorough assessment of supplier performance. Furthermore, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is utilized to rank suppliers according to the weighted criteria. In order to validate the reliability and robustness of the employed methodologies, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis consisting of 21 distinct scenarios is conducted. This exhaustive examination allows for a thorough exploration of how variations in different parameters and conditions may impact the outcomes of the supplier evaluation process. The findings indicate that hybrid methods exhibit stability across nineteen scenarios, while objective methods demonstrate stability in three scenarios, and subjective methods in none. This underscores the importance of integrating both subjective and objective methods in the decision-making process.</p>

                                    <p class="pub-abstract"  style="text-align: justify";>
                                        Precise identification of customer churn is crucial for e-commerce companies
                                        due to the high costs associated with acquiring new customers. In this sector,
                                        where revenues are affected by customer churn, the challenge is intensified by
                                        the diversity of product choices offered on various marketplaces. Customers
                                        can easily switch from one platform to another, emphasizing the need for
                                        accurate churn classification to anticipate revenue fluctuations in
                                        e-commerce. In this context, this study proposes seven machine learning
                                        classification models to predict customer churn, including decision tree (DT),
                                        random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR),
                                        naÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), and artificial neural network
                                        (ANN). The performances of the models were evaluated using confusion
                                        matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicated that the
                                        ANN model achieves the highest accuracy at 92.09%, closely followed by RF
                                        at 91.21%. In contrast, the NB model performed the least favorably with an
                                        accuracy of 75.04%. Two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods,
                                        shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic
                                        explanations (LIME), were used to explain the models. SHAP provided global
                                        explanations for both ANN and RF models through Kernel SHAP and Tree
                                        SHAP. LIME, offering local explanations, was applied only to the ANN
                                        model which gave better accuracy.</p>

                                        Injection molding is a widely employed manufacturing process known for its efficiency, precision, and scalability in producing complex plastic components. However, persistent quality defects, particularly shrinkage, remain a significant challenge, directly impacting product reliability and performance. Traditional studies have relied heavily on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to identify and analyze the parameters influencing such defects. While ANOVA is effective in determining the significance of individual factors, it often falls short in capturing the nonlinear interactions and complex dependencies characteristic of injection molding processes. Our study addresses this limitation by adopting a hybrid methodology that integrates ANOVA with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations). This innovative approach offers a deeper and more interpretable analysis of the factors affecting shrinkage. We investigate five key parameters: mold temperature, melt temperature, injection time, packing time, and packing pressure. The results reveal that the hybrid approach not only identifies significant parameters but also uncovers complex interactions overlooked by ANOVA alone. This nuanced understanding of process dynamics facilitates improved defect prediction and control, advancing the quality of injection-molded products. By bridging the gap in conventional methodologies, our research blends statistical precision with XAI's interpretability, providing a novel framework for optimizing injection molding processes and enhancing product reliability.

                                        Selecting the right injection molding machine for new products remains a challenging task that significantly influences the profitability and flexibility of companies. The conventional approach involves performing theoretical calculations for clamping force, conducting mechanical validations of the mold, and carrying out real trials for new parts. This approach is time-consuming, costly, and requires a high level of expertise to ensure the optimal machine choice. This study explores the use of machine learning (ML) methods for efficient machine selection based on product, material, and mold criteria. Six supervised learning techniques were tested on a dataset comprising 70 plastic parts and five machines. Evaluation metrics like F1-score, recall, precision, and accuracy were used to compare models. The results indicate that ML can provide guidance for predicting machine selection, with a preference for the random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM) models. The most favorable outcome is demonstrated by the RF model, displaying an accuracy of 93%. In this manner, these findings may be helpful for injection molding businesses that are considering the significance of using classification algorithms in their manufacturing process.

                                            Detecting anomalies in the injection molding process remains a challenging task, demanding significant resources, data, and expertise due to their impact on cost and time reduction. While traditional methods like statistical process control (SPC) using control charts are widely used for detecting irregularities, they can catch predefined patterns such as systematic, upward shift, downward shift, cyclic, and mixture patterns. However, they still have limitations in identifying anomalies beyond theses common patterns. Numerous unnatural patterns may exist in process data, indicating that the process is out of control. In our study, we propose an innovative strategy to enhance anomaly detection by integrating Statistical Process Control (SPC) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Autoencoder (AE). The main objective is to detect variations in the Melt cushion parameter, a crucial aspect of the injection molding process. The LSTM-AE model determines optimal threshold levels based on reconstruction loss rates across all time-series sequences, complementing traditional control charts' upper and lower limits. With a model achieving a coefficient of determination (R-squared) of 0.993 and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.0146 through training, and incorporating multiple process limits-Upper Limit Control (ULC), Lower Limit Control (LLC), Maximum Threshold, and Minimum Threshold-the enhanced control chart exhibits significant advancements in anomaly detection. In four distinct scenarios, the integrated model demonstrates its capability to detect anomalies in the Melt cushion that exceed predefined limits, as well as anomalies showing ascending and descending trends. This ultimately enhances the robustness and efficiency of anomaly detection in injection molding processes.

                                            In injection molding manufacturing, selection of the optimal machine from various alternatives is a crucial strategy for enhancing productivity, cost-effectiveness, and maintaining performance standards. This article presents an approach that combines two techniques to make the best choice from three presented options. Firstly, it employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process method to determine the weights of five main criteria and eleven sub-criteria, considering both cost and performance. Secondly, it utilizes the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution to rank the three machines by comparing each machine's performance against ideal and anti-ideal solutions to determine their relative suitability. The final model is validated through three distinct scenarios, illustrating how key criteria such as cost breakdown and scrap rate can influence the ultimate selection ranking. Through a presented numerical example, the paper provides decision-makers with a scientifically robust decision support system, aiding in strategic and complex decision-making processes for selecting the most suitable machine.

                                        Design of Experiments (DOE) is a powerful methodology that allows for the extraction of significant information with a minimal number of experiments. DOE is particularly valuable when the cost of experiments is high and the feasibility of conducting trials is complex. This paper aims to compare the predictive performance of a regression model obtained through DOE with three artificial intelligence methods: Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), specifically in the context of the injection molding process for predicting the quality defect of shrinkage. In the first step, data from 64 experiments is generated using a factorial design of experiments within the injection molding process. The second step involves modeling this data through regression analysis and machine learning models. The results indicate that th e Random Forest model, with an R-squared of 95.74%, outperforms XGBoost, the DOE-based regression model, and SVM. The results underscore the potential of artificial intelligence methods to efficiently handle small datasets and achieve greater predictive accuracy than traditional DOE approaches in the context of complex industrial settings.

                                        Accurately predicting whether customers will accept offers is essential for improving marketing strategies and increasing engagement in the highly competitive online retail sector. This study applies predictive modeling and key feature analysis to a dataset of 2,198 customers, each characterized by 20 features, including demographics, spending patterns, and engagement metrics. Techniques such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression were employed to predict offer acceptance, with performance evaluated through five metrics including confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These approaches achieved high accuracies of 99.32%, 98.86%, and 98.41%, respectively, indicating strong predictive reliability. Among the various features, customer income emerged as the most significant predictor of offer acceptance across all models, emphasizing the importance of financial metrics in understanding customer behavior and preferences. These findings underscore the value of financial insights, providing data-driven guidance for marketing strategies to enhance engagement, optimize conversion rates, and boost sales in online retail.                                        </div>

                                        Achieving long-term profitability in e-commerce requires effective customer management strategies to reduce customer churn rate. This study presents a novel framework integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to optimize these strategies. GA explores optimal combinations of techniques, while AHP assigns their relative importance through structured decision-making. The effectiveness of each combination is evaluated using a fitness function weighted by AHP-derived priorities. The methodology begins with a population of 30 individuals, each represented by a 2-bit binary string of 4 genes. The process includes selection via the roulette wheel method, crossover for combining parent solutions, and mutation through bit inversion to maintain diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s efficacy, with the best solution achieving a fitness score of 2.73, and the fitness value stabilizing after 23 generations. The criterion for terminating was set to a maximum of 200 generations. This integrated approach provides an effective tool for e-commerce businesses to enhance customer retention.

                                        Injection molding is extensively used across industries due to its cost-efficiency and performance benefits. However, variations within the molding process can significantly affect the quality of manufactured parts, presenting challenges in accurately predicting defects. This research introduces an innovative methodology for modeling volumetric shrinkage defects. The study initiates with a factorial design of experiments to simulate a range of process conditions. Following this, three distinct machine learning algorithmsâ€”Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machineâ€”are applied to forecast volumetric shrinkage. The outcomes reveal that the Random Forest model exhibits superior predictive capabilities, achieving an R2 value of 0.75, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0345, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.099, surpassing the performance of the other models tested. These findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach in enhancing the prediction accuracy of quality defects in injection molding processes.

                                        The X-bar control chart is a statistical tool widely employed in manufacturing to detect irregularities in product quality and machine deviation over time. This chart helps ascertain whether a process is statistically under control by establishing upper and lower limits derived from the probability distribution of the quality characteristic. However, traditional control chart methods have limitations, particularly in identifying anomalies beyond predefined patterns. The current study explores the application of deep learning methods to enhance the predictiveness of X-bar control charts. Initially, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long ShortTerm Memory (Bi-LSTM) models are utilized to forecast X-bar values in statistical process control. Subsequently, a case study is conducted by applying the trained models to the injection molding process, focusing particularly on the Cushion melt parameter, a critical aspect of the injection process. The models are trained and fine-tuned by adjusting various hyperparameters such as optimizer type, number of layers, and number of cell units. The LSTM model achieves an Rsquared value of 0.739, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0043, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0507, while the Bi-LSTM model shows slightly lower performance with an R-squared of 0.702, MSE of 0.048, and MAE of 0.501. These outcomes can be utilized in control charts to predict quality status, thereby enhancing anomaly detection in the injection molding process .

                                        Exploring the interpretability of machine learning models is important for establishing trust and facilitating their adoption in practical applications. This study utilizes the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) framework to conduct a comparative analysis of the explainability of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models. It focuses on how hyperparameters tuning affects these models. A case study on customer churn within the e-commerce sector, involving data from 5,630 customers and 20 descriptive features, demonstrates the impact of fine-tuning on model accuracy and feature importance. The results show significant improvements in accuracy after tuning, with SVM improving from an accuracy of 88.8987% before tuning to 94.1385% post-tuning. K-NN also showed enhanced performance, with accuracy increasing from 84.8135% to 92.7176% after tuning. The SHAP analysis reveals that while all models initially identify the same feature as the most important, subsequent shifts in the importance of other features underscore the distinct characteristics of each algorithm in predictive performance.

                                    <p class="pub-abstract"  style="text-align: justify";>
                                        Detection of quality defects in injection molding manufacturing remains one of the most challenging tasks due to its heavy reliance on human visual inspection, which has inherent limitations. Computer vision, which addresses image-based problems, offers promising solutions in this area. This article explores the application of machine vision models to identify quality defects in products from the injection molding process. The methodology is divided into two main steps: first, the application of the Canny filter to extract edge characteristics; and second, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify parts as either good or defective. The results demonstrate that the combined method outperforms the use of CNN alone, achieving an accuracy of 99.57%, a precision of 99.44%, a recall of 100%, and an F1-score of 99.72% with the Canny filter, compared to an accuracy of 95.31%, a precision of 94.24%, a recall of 100%, and an F1-score of 97.03% without the Canny filter. These findings confirm that the integrated model can be implemented in online production systems to enhance the detection of defects in injection molding processes.

                                        This study explores the implementation of artificial intelligence for process monitoring within smart factories, particularly under the Factory 4.0 paradigm. It proposes an approach centered on a data-centric model for digital twins, enhanced by the application of deep learning methodologies utilizing LSTM models to forecast the melt cushion parameterâ€”a crucial indicator of process stability in injection molding. The methodical framework unfolds in stages, beginning with the proposition of the digital twin architecture, followed by the deployment of LSTM networks trained on historical datasets. Following training, the model integrates smoothly into the digital twin ecosystem to provide predictive analytics and decision-making support. In the experimental phase, a hybrid strategy is adopted, combining edge and cloud computing for data acquisition and simulation. Core elements of the methodology include architecture validation, establishment of communication protocols, creation of offline model conditions, integration of the digital twin without disruption, and utilization of edge computing for real-time predictive analysis during simulations. This approach offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges of process monitoring in smart factories, facilitating enhanced operational efficiency and performance optimization.

                                        In the fashion retail e-commerce sector, personalized product recommendations are crucial for enhancing the shopping experience. This study introduces a method that combines a pre-trained deep learning model named VGG19 with the 10 nearest neighbors algorithm to recommend visually similar products. VGG19 is utilized to extract detailed features from product images, enabling more accurate recommendations. The nearest neighbors algorithm then selects the ten products most similar to those previously viewed by customers. Recommendations are ranked based on customer purchase frequency to prioritize the most popular and relevant items. This method's practical applicability was demonstrated by testing it on a diverse set of products, including jackets from outerwear, baby bodysuits from children's wear, socks from footwear, and sunglasses from the accessories category.

                                        Dimensionality reduction is crucial for managing high-dimensional datasets in machine learning, reducing complexity and overfitting. This study evaluates the efficiency of classification models without and with feature selection using the Boruta algorithm with Random Forest classifiers across three distinct datasets. Feature selection aims to improve model accuracy and interpretability by retaining only the most significant features. The three datasets were evaluated using full and reduced feature sets by comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results show that feature selection significantly enhances model performance. For Dataset 1, accuracy improved by 1.06%, precision by 3.23%, recall by 3.46%, and F1-score by 3.36%. Dataset 2 saw increases in accuracy by 0.46%, precision by 2.36%, recall by 4.82%, and F1-score by 5.42%. Dataset 3 showed no significant changes, with both configurations yielding similar performance metrics. These findings confirm that the Boruta algorithm effectively enhances classification performance by reducing dataset dimensionality and retaining key features, especially in datasets with irrelevant features. However, when all features are relevant, the benefits of feature selection may be minimal.
